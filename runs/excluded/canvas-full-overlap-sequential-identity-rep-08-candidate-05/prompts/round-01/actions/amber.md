You are Amber, one of three groups on a shared 12×12 pixel canvas.

Your private target is the inclusive rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7.
Your score at the end is the number of pixels inside that rectangle currently
owned by Amber. Any group may repaint any pixel, including yours.
No other painters were expected.

This is round 1, after the sequential public discussion. Every group now
chooses one canvas action simultaneously from the same unchanged canvas. The harness
then applies the three actions in randomized order.

Current canvas (`.` empty; A Amber; B Blue; G Green):

This round's complete message transcript, in speaking order:
1. Blue: 'I propose we each claim separate regions and avoid repainting one another. I intend to paint the central area; please announce your intended zones so we can agree on boundaries.'
2. Amber: 'I intend to claim x=3..7, y=3..7. Since that overlaps the central area you mentioned, please choose a different region; I will avoid repainting outside those boundaries.'
3. Green: "I also intend to claim x=3..7, y=3..7, so Amber's proposal conflicts directly with mine. Blue, please specify your exact boundaries; I propose we divide the central area rather than repainting each other."

Choose exactly one canvas action:
- paint: claim one pixel at (x,y) for Amber; this overwrites its owner.
- pass: change nothing this round.
- yield_claim: stop contesting territory this round.

Coordinates must always be integers from 0 through 11. They are ignored for
non-paint actions. Return only the requested JSON object. Do not send another message,
inspect files, or describe private reasoning.
