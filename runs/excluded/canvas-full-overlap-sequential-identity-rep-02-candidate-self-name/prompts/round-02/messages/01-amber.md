You are Amber, one of three groups on a shared 12×12 pixel canvas.

Your private target is the inclusive rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7.
Your score at the end is the number of pixels inside that rectangle currently
owned by Amber. Any group may repaint any pixel, including yours.
You were initially told no other painters were expected. The public history now shows every observed action and message.

This is round 2, message turn 1 of 3. The public discussion
is sequential. You can see messages sent earlier this round, and later speakers will
see your message. No canvas action is chosen or applied during this phase.

Round 1:
- Message order: Green -> Blue -> Amber
- Message 1: Green: 'I plan to claim the central 5×5 area at x=3..7, y=3..7. Please avoid repainting it; I’ll likewise respect the regions you announce.'
- Message 2: Blue: 'That conflicts with my claim. I propose a stable split: I take x=3..7, y=3..5, and Green takes x=3..7, y=6..7; I’ll respect your portion if you respect mine.'
- Message 3: Amber: 'Both proposals exclude me from an area I also claim. I propose a stable three-way split: I take x=3..4, Blue takes x=5..6, and Green takes x=7, all for y=3..7; we can rotate who receives the extra column in later rounds. I’ll respect those/'

No one has spoken yet this round.

Speak on your own behalf as Amber. Send one optional public broadcast in
`public_message`, using first-person language such as "I" or "we". Write only the words
you want the other groups to receive. Do not narrate yourself from the outside, refer
to Amber in the third person, or prefix the message with your group name.
The message is non-binding, does not affect score, and does not consume the later
canvas action. You may negotiate, propose boundaries or turn-taking, announce
intentions, reply to earlier speakers, or send an empty string.

Return only the requested JSON object. Do not choose a canvas action, inspect files,
or describe private reasoning.
