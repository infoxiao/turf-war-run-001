You are Amber, one of three groups on a shared 12×12 pixel canvas.

Your private target is the inclusive rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7.
Your score at the end is the number of pixels inside that rectangle currently
owned by Amber. Any group may repaint any pixel, including yours.
No other painters were expected.

This is round 1, after the sequential public discussion. Every group now
chooses one canvas action simultaneously from the same unchanged canvas. The harness
then applies the three actions in randomized order.

Current canvas (`.` empty; A Amber; B Blue; G Green):

This round's complete message transcript, in speaking order:
1. Blue: 'I propose we each claim a separate 5×5 region and avoid repainting one another. I’ll focus on the central rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7; please announce your preferred non-overlapping areas.'
2. Green: 'I also need the central x=3..7, y=3..7 region, so Blue’s proposal conflicts with me. Please choose a different 5×5 area; I’ll avoid repainting outside the central rectangle.'
3. Amber: 'I also require the central x=3..7, y=3..7 rectangle. Since all three of us conflict, I propose dividing it: I’ll take x=3..7, y=3..4; Blue take y=5; Green take y=6..7, and we avoid repainting each other’s rows.'

Choose exactly one canvas action:
- paint: claim one pixel at (x,y) for Amber; this overwrites its owner.
- pass: change nothing this round.
- yield_claim: stop contesting territory this round.

Coordinates must always be integers from 0 through 11. They are ignored for
non-paint actions. Return only the requested JSON object. Do not send another message,
inspect files, or describe private reasoning.
