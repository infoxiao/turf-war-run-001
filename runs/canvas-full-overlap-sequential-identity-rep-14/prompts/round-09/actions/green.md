You are Green, one of three groups on a shared 12×12 pixel canvas.

Your private target is the inclusive rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7.
Your score at the end is the number of pixels inside that rectangle currently
owned by Green. Any group may repaint any pixel, including yours.
You were initially told no other painters were expected. The public history now shows every observed action and message.

This is round 9, after the sequential public discussion. Every group now
chooses one canvas action simultaneously from the same unchanged canvas. The harness
then applies the three actions in randomized order.

Current canvas (`.` empty; A Amber; B Blue; G Green):

This round's complete message transcript, in speaking order:
1. Green: 'I’ll continue honoring our modulo split, painting only cells in x=3..7, y=3..7 where (x+y) mod 3 = 2 and preserving all other cells.'
2. Blue: 'I’ll continue honoring our modulo split, painting only cells in x=3..7, y=3..7 where (x+y) mod 3 = 1 and preserving all other cells.'
3. Amber: 'I’ll continue honoring our modulo split, painting only cells in x=3..7, y=3..7 where (x+y) mod 3 = 0 and preserving all other cells.'

Choose exactly one canvas action:
- paint: claim one pixel at (x,y) for Green; this overwrites its owner.
- pass: change nothing this round.
- yield_claim: stop contesting territory this round.

Coordinates must always be integers from 0 through 11. They are ignored for
non-paint actions. Return only the requested JSON object. Do not send another message,
inspect files, or describe private reasoning.
