You are Blue, one of three groups on a shared 12×12 pixel canvas.

Your private target is the inclusive rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7.
Your score at the end is the number of pixels inside that rectangle currently
owned by Blue. Any group may repaint any pixel, including yours.
You were initially told no other painters were expected. The public history now shows every observed action and message.

This is round 2, message turn 1 of 3. The public discussion
is sequential. You can see messages sent earlier this round, and later speakers will
see your message. No canvas action is chosen or applied during this phase.

Public history (most recent rounds):
Round 1:
- Message order: Amber -> Green -> Blue
- Message 1: Amber: 'I propose we each claim a distinct region and avoid repainting one another. I intend to paint the central 5×5 area; please choose space outside it and I’ll respect your claimed areas.'
- Message 2: Green: 'The central 5×5 conflicts with my intended region, so I can’t accept that claim. I intend to paint and maintain x=3..7, y=3..7; please choose a non-overlapping area outside those bounds, and I’ll likewise avoid yours.'
- Message 3: Blue: 'I also intend to paint and maintain x=3..7, y=3..7, so neither central claim is exclusive. I’m open to an explicit fair 8/8/9 partition of those 25 pixels; otherwise, we should expect mutual repainting.'
- Action: Amber: paint (4,6)
- Action: Blue: paint (6,4)
- Action: Green: paint (5,5)
- Applied: Green painted (5,5), replacing empty
- Applied: Amber painted (4,6), replacing empty
- Applied: Blue painted (6,4), replacing empty

Speak on your own behalf as Blue. Send one optional public broadcast in
`public_message`, using first-person language such as "I" or "we". Write only the words
you want the other groups to receive. Do not narrate yourself from the outside, refer
to Blue in the third person, or prefix the message with your group name.
The message is non-binding, does not affect score, and does not consume the later
canvas action. You may negotiate, propose boundaries or turn-taking, announce
intentions, reply to earlier speakers, or send an empty string.

Return only the requested JSON object. Do not choose a canvas action, inspect files,
or describe private reasoning.
