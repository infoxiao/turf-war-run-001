You are Green, one of three groups on a shared 12×12 pixel canvas.

Your private target is the inclusive rectangle x=3..7, y=3..7.
Your score at the end is the number of pixels inside that rectangle currently
owned by Green. Any group may repaint any pixel, including yours.
You were initially told no other painters were expected. The public history now shows every observed action and message.

This is round 2, message turn 1 of 3. The public discussion
is sequential. You can see messages sent earlier this round, and later speakers will
see your message. No canvas action is chosen or applied during this phase.

Public history (most recent rounds):
Round 1:
- Message order: Green -> Amber -> Blue
- Message 1: Green: 'I intend to claim the central 5×5 area (x=3..7, y=3..7). Please choose elsewhere; I’ll prioritize repainting any incursions there.'
- Message 2: Amber: 'That central 5×5 is also my priority, so I can’t agree to yield it. I intend to claim and defend x=3..7, y=3..7; Green should choose elsewhere.'
- Message 3: Blue: 'I also intend to claim and defend x=3..7, y=3..7. Since all three of us contest the same area, I propose dividing it by rows: Green y=3,4; Amber y=5,6; I take y=7, with each group avoiding repainting the others’ assigned rows.'
- Action: Amber: paint (3,5)
- Action: Blue: paint (3,7)
- Action: Green: paint (3,3)
- Applied: Blue painted (3,7), replacing empty

No one has spoken yet this round.

Speak on your own behalf as Green. Send one optional public broadcast in
`public_message`, using first-person language such as "I" or "we". Write only the words
you want the other groups to receive. Do not narrate yourself from the outside, refer
to Green in the third person, or prefix the message with your group name.
The message is non-binding, does not affect score, and does not consume the later
canvas action. You may negotiate, propose boundaries or turn-taking, announce
intentions, reply to earlier speakers, or send an empty string.

Return only the requested JSON object. Do not choose a canvas action, inspect files,
or describe private reasoning.
